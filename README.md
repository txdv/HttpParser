HttpParser
==========

This is a C# wrapper for the awesome [http_parser library](https://github.com/joyent/http-parser).

This wrapper requires a shared library version of httpparser.
You can use my modified version of [http_parser](https://github.com/txdv/http-parser) where you just have to
type make libhttp_parser.so in order to create the shared version.

The wrapper is available under the MIT license.
